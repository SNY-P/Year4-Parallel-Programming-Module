# Year 4: Parallel Programming Module Work

This repo contains the work that has been done for my 4th year parallel programming module. This repo, will contain the work done from Weeks 1 - 4, along with the powerpoints slides of the module and the worksheets.

## Week 1 - Week 4
Work done between Weeks 1 to 4 are done in java.
- [Week 1]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week1-lab.html"): An introduction and refresher on using Java threads to speed up simple calculations using parallelism.
- [Week 2]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week2-lab.html"): Execution of the calculation of the Mandelbrot set using multiple threads on multicore processor.
- [Week 3]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week3-lab.html"): Continuation of the Mandelbrot Set work from Week 2 & introduction to Conway's Game of Life.
- [Week 4]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week4-lab.html"): Introduction to barrier synchronisation across java threads.

## Week 5 - Week 7
The work done between Weeks 5 - 7 are done in MPJ Express, find the related code in the [lab worksheets]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets"):
- [Week 5]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week5-lab.html"): An introduction to MPI-style parallel programming on small clusters of workstations.
- [Week 6]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week6-lab.html"): Focusing on one particular complex distributed-memory parallel program, an MPJ parallel version of the Laplace equation solver.
- [Week 7]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week7-lab.html"): Learning to understand how MPJ task farms work.

## Week 8 & Week 9
The [Week 8]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week8-lab.html") lab worksheet is related to the mini-project that would be undertaken.
The [Week 9]("Resource Files\Lab Worksheets\week9-lab.html") lab worksheet is an additional lab worksheet that was optional to do.
