# Year 4: Parallel Programming Module Work

This repo contains the work that has been done for my 4th year parallel programming module. This repo, will contain the work done from Weeks 1 - 4, along with the powerpoints slides of the module and the worksheets.

## Week 1 - Week 4
Work done between Weeks 1 to 4 are done in java.
- [Week 1](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week1-lab.html): An introduction and refresher on using Java threads to speed up simple calculations using parallelism.
- [Week 2](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week2-lab.html): Execution of the calculation of the Mandelbrot set using multiple threads on multicore processor.
- [Week 3](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week3-lab.html): Continuation of the Mandelbrot Set work from Week 2 & introduction to Conway's Game of Life.
- [Week 4](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week4-lab.html): Introduction to barrier synchronisation across java threads.

## Week 5 - Week 7
The work done between Weeks 5 - 7 are done in MPJ Express, find the related code in the [lab worksheets](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets):
- [Week 5](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week5-lab.html): An introduction to MPI-style parallel programming on small clusters of workstations.
- [Week 6](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week6-lab.html): Focusing on one particular complex distributed-memory parallel program, an MPJ parallel version of the Laplace equation solver.
- [Week 7](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week7-lab.html): Learning to understand how MPJ task farms work.

## Week 8 & Week 9
The [Week 8](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week8-lab.html) lab worksheet is related to the mini-project that would be undertaken.
The [Week 9](/Resource%20Files/Lab%20Worksheets/week9-lab.html) lab worksheet is an additional lab worksheet that was optional to do.

## Mini-Project
The [mini-project](/Mini-Project/) that was undertaken for the second half of the coursework was the RayTracer project that was given as an option from the week 8 lab worksheet.
