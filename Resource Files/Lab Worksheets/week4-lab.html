<h1>Parallel Programming Lab, Week 4:<br>Parallel Programs with Interacting Threads</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
We are approaching the end of our brief introduction to parallel programming
on shared memory systems - in our case the multicore processors on a desktop
or laptop PC.
In this lab we will see how to use barrier synchronization across threads
in Java.  I also introduce one new example - a problem from science and
engineering called Laplace's Equation.  As an extra topic, there is
brief foray into OpenMP.</p>

<h2>A Parallel Game of Life</h2>

<p>
Read over last week's lecture about race conditions and barrier
sychronization in parallel programs.  Here is a fully synchronized
(and correct!) parallel version of Conway's Game of Life:
</p><pre>  import java.awt.* ;
  import javax.swing.* ;
  
  import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier ;
  
  public class ParallelLife extends Thread {
  
      final static int N = 256 ;
      final static int P = 256 ;  // Number of threads
      final static int CELL_SIZE = 4 ;
      final static int DELAY = 0 ;
  
      static int [][] state = new int [N][N] ;
      static int [][] sums  = new int [N][N] ;
  
      static Display display = new Display() ;
  
      static CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(P) ;
  
      public static void main(String args []) throws Exception {
  
          // Define initial state of Life board
  
          for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
              for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                  state [i] [j] = Math.random() &gt; 0.5 ? 1 : 0 ;
              }
          }
  
          display.repaint() ;
          pause() ;
  
          ParallelLife [] threads = new ParallelLife [P] ;
          for(int me = 0 ; me &lt; P ; me++) {
              threads [me] = new ParallelLife(me) ;
              threads [me].start() ;
          }
  
          for(int me = 0 ; me &lt; P ; me++) {
              threads [me].join() ;
          }
      }
  
      int me ;
  
      ParallelLife(int me) {
          this.me = me ;
      }
  
      final static int B = N / P ;  // block size
   
      public void run() {
          
          int begin = me * B ;
          int end = begin + B ;
  
          // Main update loop.
  
          int iter = 0 ;
          while(true) {
  
              if(me == 0)
                  System.out.println("iter = " + iter++) ;
  
              // Calculate neighbour sums.
  
              for(int i = begin ; i &lt; end ; i++) {
                   for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
  
                        // find neighbours...
                        int ip = (i + 1) % N ;
                        int im = (i - 1 + N) % N ;
                        int jp = (j + 1) % N ;
                        int jm = (j - 1 + N) % N ;
  
                        sums [i] [j] =
                            state [im] [jm] + state [im] [ j] + state [im] [jp] +
                            state [ i] [jm]                   + state [ i] [jp] +
                            state [ip] [jm] + state [ip] [ j] + state [ip] [jp] ;
                  }
              }

</pre>
If you followed the advice in last week's lab script you may have come
up with something similar - though at that stage probably would not have
put in the important <i>barriers</i>.<p></p>

<p>
For barrier synchronization we are using the standard Java class:
</p><pre>  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CyclicBarrier.html">java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier</a>
</pre>
Note the constructor of this takes the number of threads that are
to be synchronized as an argument.  It is convenient here to wrap the call
to <tt>await()</tt> in our own method <tt>synch()</tt>, just to get the
annoying code for exception handling out of the main logic.<p></p>

<p>
Each thread
can call <tt>await()</tt> on a single barrier many times - this is the
sense in which it is "cyclic".  But, each time it is called,
<i>all </i><tt>P</tt><i> threads must make the call</i> (this
is sometimes called a <i>collective call</i>.)</p>

<p>
Run this program and check the behaviour looks plausibly correct.
Notice we are running a relatively <i>small</i> Life board in a rather
<i>large</i> number of threads (much larger than the available number of
cores).  The idea here is just to push the envelope with the level of
concurrency in the program, to get some confidence that a parallel
program with synchronization really does always get results <i>correct</i>.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't do something similar last week, comment out the two
calls to <tt>synch</tt>, and run the program again.  Is it working correctly?
What if you only comment out <i>one</i> of the two calls - are they
both essential?</p>

<h2>Solving the Laplace Equation</h2>

<p>
We will leave benchmarking the parallel Game of Life as an exercise.
Before attempting that, study the new example below.</p>

<p>First, a mathematical aside.  You may or may not find this helpful - in
the end we are just interested in parallelizing a given sequential
algorithm...</p>

<p>
The two dimensional
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace&#39;s_equation">Laplace
equation</a> is an equation that crops up in several places in physics
and mathematics.  We don't need to worry much about what those
places are - it is introduced here just as an example of a relatively
simple numerical problem in science and engineering that can be tackled
by parallel programming.</p>

<p>
We are interested in the Laplace equation on a two-dimensional grid
of points.  In this incarnation, if
we store the unknown variables of the equation in the elements of an
array called <tt>phi</tt>, then one way of writing the equations for
these variables is:
</p><pre>  phi [i] [j] =
      0.25 * (phi [i] [j - 1] + phi [i] [j + 1] +
              phi [i - 1] [j] + phi [i + 1] [j])
</pre>
In other words, the element <tt>phi [i] [j]</tt> should be equal to the
<i>average</i> of its four immediately neighbouring elements.  This
condition has to be satisfied <i>everywhere</i> in some region of
the (<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>) grid.  (Often we are <i>given</i> fixed values
of <tt>phi</tt> around the borders of the region in question, and required
to find the values of <tt>phi</tt> <i>inside</i> the region.)<p></p>

<p>
An <i>iterative</i> numerical approach to solving the equation is just
to initially set all elements of <tt>phi</tt> that we have to solve for
to some value like zero, then repeatedly change individual <tt>phi
[i] [j]</tt> elements to be the average of their neighbours.  If we repeat
this local update sufficiently many times, the <tt>phi</tt> elements
converge to the global solution of the equations.  This is called the
<i>relaxation method</i>.</p>

<p>
That is the end of our mathematical aside.  Now just try to run the
sequential program below:
</p><pre>  import java.awt.* ;
  import javax.swing.* ;
  
  public class Laplace {
  
      final static int N = 256 ;
      final static int CELL_SIZE = 2 ; 
      final static int NITER = 100000 ;
      final static int OUTPUT_FREQ = 1 ;
  
      static float [][] phi = new float [N][N] ;
      static float [][] newPhi = new float [N][N] ;
  
      static Display display = new Display() ;
  
      public static void main(String args []) throws Exception {
  
          // Make voltage non-zero on left and right edges
  
          for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
              phi [0] [j] = 1.0F ;
              phi [N-1] [j] = 1.0F ;
          }
  
          display.repaint() ;
  
          // Main update loop.
  
          long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
  
          for(int iter = 0 ; iter &lt; NITER ; iter++) {
  
              // Calculate new phi
  
              for(int i = 1 ; i &lt; N - 1 ; i++) {
                   for(int j = 1 ; j &lt; N - 1 ; j++) {
  
                        newPhi [i] [j] =
                                0.25F * (phi [i] [j - 1] + phi [i] [j + 1] +
                                         phi [i - 1] [j] + phi [i + 1] [j]) ;
                  }
              }
  
              // Update all phi values
      
              for(int i = 1 ; i &lt; N - 1 ; i++) {
                  for(int j = 1 ; j &lt; N - 1 ; j++) {
                      phi [i] [j] = newPhi [i] [j] ;
                  }
              }
      
              if(iter % OUTPUT_FREQ == 0) {
                  System.out.println("iter = " + iter) ;
                  display.repaint() ;
              }
          }
  
          long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
  
          System.out.println("Calculation completed in " +
                             (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
  
          display.repaint() ;
      }
  
      static class Display extends JPanel {
  
          final static int WINDOW_SIZE = N * CELL_SIZE ;
  
          Display() {
  
              setPreferredSize(new Dimension(WINDOW_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE)) ;
  
              JFrame frame = new JFrame("Laplace");
              frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
              frame.setContentPane(this);
              frame.pack();
              frame.setVisible(true);
          }
  
          public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
              for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
                  for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                      float f = phi [i] [j] ;
                      Color c = new Color(f, 0.0F, 1.0F - f) ;
                      g.setColor(c) ;
                      g.fillRect(CELL_SIZE * i, CELL_SIZE * j,
                                 CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE) ;
                  }
              } 
          }
      }
  }
</pre>
In this example, the region of the <i>(i, j)</i> plane where we are
calculating <tt>phi</tt> is given by the range of values
<i>i</i> = 1, ..., <i>N</i>-2 and <i>j</i> = 1, ..., <i>N</i>-2.<p></p>

<p>On the outer boundary of the square (<i>i</i> or <i>j</i> are 0 or
<i>N</i>-1) <tt>phi</tt> stays fixed -
equal to zero on the top and bottom edges and 1.0 on the left and right
edges (<i>boundary conditions</i>).</p>

<p>
Pictorially, the array is organized like this:
</p>
<p>
<img src="./week4-lab_files/LaplaceSequential.jpg" height="400">
</p>
<p>
The yellow border represents array elements where the field <tt>phi</tt>
is set to fixed boundary values.  The central green area represents
array elements that will be updated in the algorithm.  The numbers at
the side of the grid represent the ranges of the indexes used in the
update loops.</p>

<p>An engineering way of thinking of this is that we have a hollow
metal box with a fixed voltage of 0 on the top and bottom faces,
and a fixed voltage of 1 on the left and right faces.  Then the solution
for the inner <tt>phi</tt> elements is the <i>voltage field</i> (or more
correctly the <i>electrical potential</i>) in the space inside the box.</p>

<p>
On the display a voltage of zero is represented by the colour blue and
a voltage of 1.0 is represented by the colour red.</p>

<p>
Initially only the
extreme left and right edges are red.  But as voltages are averaged with
neighbours over many iterations the "redness" spreads over the square.
Eventually we reached a converged state for the voltage field, with
red and blue areas symmetric in the square.  This is now an approximate
solution of the Laplace equation</p>

<p>
Don't get bogged down in the details.  Look at the form of the code.
The overall pattern is very similar to the Life simulation we ran earlier.
There is an outer loop over iterations which is now itself a for loop,
but that doesn't change parallelization of the inner loops.</p>

<p>
Apart from the small matter of the actual calculation inside the inner
loops that we want to parallelize, there is only one minor change to their
structure - the ranges of <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> now go from
1 to <span class="eqn"><i>N</i>-2</span> rather than 0 to
<span class="eqn"><i>N</i>-1</span>.</p>

<p>
When you come to parallelize this, I suggest you take this into account
by code like something like this:
</p><pre>        int begin = me * B ;
        int end = begin + B ;

        if(me == 0)
            begin = 1 ;

        if(me == P-1)
            end = N - 1 ;
</pre>
inside the <tt>run()</tt> methods of the threads - modifying the domains
in the leftmost and rightmost threads.<p></p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Try to parallelize the <tt>Laplace</tt> following a pattern almost
identical to the one used in <tt>ParallelLife</tt> above.
<!--
If you get really stuck, there is a solution <a
href="parallel-laplace.html">here</a>.
-->
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Benchmark the sequential and parallel version of the Laplace equation using
various number of threads (e.g. 2, 4, 8).  Calculate parallel speedups
and efficiencies.
</p>
<p>
Before doing benchmarks, <i>increase the value of the
</i><tt>OUTPUT_FREQ</tt><i> constant</i> to, say, 1000.  This has the effect
of making the output happen
only every 1000 iterations.</p>
<p>
Without this change it is likely that the overhead of the graphic output
would dominate the time for the calculations, and it is the time for the
calculations that are most important here.</p>
<p>
Estimate the overheads of the barrier calls by simply commenting them out
and running again.
(This <i>may</i> lead to incorrect numerical results for the voltage field,
but it allows you to estimate how much synchronization costs!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you have access to a suitable Linux system, benchmark a parallel Life
program implemented using <i>OpenMP</i>, following the outline below.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><i>Special Topic</i>: Using OpenMP</h2>

<p>
<i>[To run this example following exactly the instructions below, you
will need access to a Linux system.  However it should be possible
to adapt to Windows if you have a compatible C/C++ IDE.]</i></p>

<p>
At the end of the week 3 lecture we briefly discussed the OpenMP "API"
for shared memory parallel programming.  Try the example below.
You will have to be prepared to edit a little C or C++, but the code here
is sufficiently similar to Java that this shouldn't be too intimidating!</p>

<p>
Under Linux, using a text editor such as <tt>gedit</tt>, create a 
file called <tt>life.cc</tt> containing the following C++ program:
</p><pre>  #include &lt;omp.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  
  #define N 32
  #define NITER 100
  
  int state [N] [N] ;
  int sums  [N] [N] ;
  
  void printCells() ;
  
  int main(int argc, char *args []) {
  
      // Define initial state of Life board
  
      for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
          for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
              state [i] [j] = random() &gt; (RAND_MAX/2) ? 1 : 0 ;
          }
      }
  
      // Main update loop.
  
      for(int iter = 0 ; iter &lt; NITER ; iter++) {
  
          printf("iter = %d\n", iter++) ;
  
          // Calculate neighbour sums.
  
          #pragma omp parallel for
          for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
              for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
  
                  // find neighbours...
                  int ip = (i + 1) % N ;
                  int im = (i - 1 + N) % N ;
                  int jp = (j + 1) % N ;
                  int jm = (j - 1 + N) % N ;
  
                  sums [i] [j] =
                       state [im] [jm] + state [im] [ j] + state [im] [jp] +
                       state [ i] [jm]                   + state [ i] [jp] +
                       state [ip] [jm] + state [ip] [ j] + state [ip] [jp] ;
              }
          }
  
          // Update state of board values.
      
          #pragma omp parallel for

This is a fully parallelized OpenMP version of "Life".  Apart from the
cruder output (I didn't want to get bogged down in C++ graphics) it should
look very much like the sequential Life code we saw last week.
The parallelization is encapsulated in just the <tt>omp</tt> pragmas in
front of the computational loops.
<p></p>

<p>
Open a terminal (Linux equivalent of Command Prompt) and compile and run
this program by:
</p><pre>  $ gcc -fopenmp life.cc
  $ ./a.out
</pre>
(<i>Don't</i> type the <tt>$</tt> - that is just my representation of
the command prompt!)<p></p>

<p>
Increase <tt>N</tt> and <tt>NITER</tt> to something more realistic (e.g.
1024 and 1000), comment out the output call <tt>printCells()</tt>,
and try some benchmarking.
You may for example use the <tt>time</tt> command in Linux to time
runs, e.g.:
</p><pre>  $ time ./a.out
</pre>
The time to record is the "real" time output by the <tt>time</tt> command.
<p></p>
<p>
To change the number of threads, issue a command such as:
</p><pre>  $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
</pre>
before running the program.<p></p>

<p>
To make a sequential program for calculating parallel speedups, either
comment out the two <tt>#pragma omp</tt> lines, or just set the
<tt>OMP_NUM_THREADS</tt> environment variable to 1.</p>
