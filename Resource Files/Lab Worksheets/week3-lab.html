<h1>Parallel Programming Lab, Week 3:<br>Workload Decompositions, and a "Simulation"</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
This week we will complete the work started last week on the parallel
Mandelbrot Set, incorporating ideas on index space decomposition formats
introduced in last week's lecture.  Then we will start parallelizing a new
example illustrative of some of the features of "simulation"-type programs.
The new example is the cellular automaton called Conway's Game of Life.
</p>

<h2>Generalizing the parallel Mandelbrot Set</h2>

<p>
If you successfully completed last week's lab, one of the programs you
produced may have looked something like this:
</p><pre>  import java.awt.Color ;
  import java.awt.image.BufferedImage ;
  
  import javax.imageio.ImageIO;
  
  import java.io.File ;
  
  public class ParallelMandelbrot extends Thread {
  
      final static int N = 4096 ;
      final static int CUTOFF = 100 ; 
  
      static int [] [] set = new int [N] [N] ;
  
      public static void main(String [] args) throws Exception {
  
          // Calculate set
  
          long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
  
          ParallelMandelbrot thread0 = new ParallelMandelbrot(0) ;
          ParallelMandelbrot thread1 = new ParallelMandelbrot(1) ;
  
          thread0.start() ;
          thread1.start() ;
  
          thread0.join() ;
          thread1.join() ;
  
          long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
  
          System.out.println("Calculation completed in " +
                             (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
  
          // Plot image
  
          BufferedImage img = new BufferedImage(N, N,
                                                BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_ARGB) ;
  
          // Draw pixels
  
          for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
              for (int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
  
                  int k = set [i] [j] ;
  
                  float level ;
                  if(k &lt; CUTOFF) {
                      level = (float) k / CUTOFF ;
                  }
                  else {
                      level = 0 ;
                  }
                  Color c = new Color(0, level, 0) ;  // Green
                  img.setRGB(i, j, c.getRGB()) ;
              }
          }
      
  
          // Print file
  
          ImageIO.write(img, "PNG", new File("Mandelbrot.png"));
      }
  
      int me ;
  
      public ParallelMandelbrot(int me) {
          this.me = me ;
      }
  
      public void run() {
  
          int begin, end ;
 
          if (me == 0) {
              begin = 0 ;
              end = N/2 ;
          }
          else {  // me == 1
              begin = N/2 ;
              end = N ;
          }

          for(int i = begin ; i &lt; end ; i++) {
              for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {

                  double cr = (4.0 * i - 2 * N) / N ;
                  double ci = (4.0 * j - 2 * N) / N ;

                  double zr = cr, zi = ci ;

                  int k = 0 ;
                  while (k &lt; CUTOFF &amp;&amp; zr * zr + zi * zi &lt; 4.0) {

                      // z = c + z * z

                      double newr = cr + zr * zr - zi * zi ;
                      double newi = ci + 2 * zr * zi ;

                      zr = newr ;
                      zi = newi ;

                      k++ ;
                  }

                  set [i] [j] = k ;
              }
          }
      }
  
  }
</pre>
In this program the calculation loop is decomposed blockwise in the
loop index <tt>i</tt>, and the work is divided over two threads.<p></p>

<p>
Now generalize this program to run on a number of threads defined by a
constant <tt>P</tt> declared near the top of the class, e.g.:
</p><pre>  final static int P = 4 ;
</pre>
Replace the code that creates, starts, and waits for completion of
<tt>thread0</tt> and <tt>thread1</tt> by something like:
<pre>        ParallelMandelbrot [] threads = new ParallelMandelbrot [P] ;
        for(int me = 0 ; me &lt; P ; me++) {
            threads [me] = new ParallelMandelbrot(me) ;
            threads [me].start() ;
        }

        for(int me = 0 ; me &lt; P ; me++) {
            threads [me].join() ;
        }
</pre>
Here we create an array of threads, and initialize and complete them in loops
(<span class="question">why do we need <i>two</i> loops over <tt>me</tt> here - could they be merged?</span>).
<p></p>

<p>
Now, inside the <tt>run</tt> method, you can achieve a generalized
block decomposition of work by changing the calculation of
<tt>begin</tt> and <tt>end</tt> to:
</p><pre>  int b = N/P ;  // block size

  begin = me * b ;
  end = begin + b ;
</pre>
This works as long as <tt>N</tt> is an exact multiple of <tt>P</tt> -
the problem size is an exact multiple of the number of threads.  (You
may want to think about how you could modify these calculations to
remove this restriction.)<p></p>

<p>
With your generalized code, run the Mandelbrot set on (say) 2, 4, and 8
threads, and record and interpret the times taken.</p>

<p>
Now use a <i>cyclic</i> decomposition.  You only need to change the
<tt>run</tt> method.  You no longer really need the variables <tt>begin</tt>
and <tt>end</tt> - instead you can just replace the loop over <tt>i</tt>
(say) with something like this:
</p><pre>  for(int i = me ; i &lt; N ; i+=P) { 
      ...
  }
</pre>
Again measure the performance with different numbers of threads.
In particular what is the <i>parallel speedup</i> on four threads and
on eight threads?
<p></p>

<p>
On the lab machines, times for this Mandelbrot set computation tend to vary
a great deal between runs.  Make sure you run all programs several times
and use the best times for sequential and parallel programs for calculating
speedup.  Anecdotally, increasing the problem size (e.g. doubling N) may make
timings more reproducible.
</p>

<h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>

<p>
The Mandelbrot Set illustrates some features of parallel programming.
But in the end it belongs to the category of what are called "embarassingly
parallel" problems.  It is easy to make it parallel because the calculation
at any point doesn't depend on the calculation at any other point.</p>

<p>
This makes it pretty easy to parallelize, but it is not a characteristic
shared by many of the important kinds of problem people are interested in
solving.  One major area of application of parallel processing is in
<i>simulations</i> of large systems.  These simulations are usually <i>not</i>
embarassingly parallel - developments in one part of the simulation usually
have direct or indirect effects on developments everywhere else.</p>

<p>
As a first example of this kind of behaviour, we will look at Conway's
Game of Life.  Again, if you haven't come across this before, look it up in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<p>
Life is a very simple example of a <i>cellular automaton</i>.
Imagine a "board" divided into square cells - something like a large "Go"
board.  Beads are placed in some of the cells of the board.
A cell is <i>live</i> if it holds a bead or <i>dead</i> if it does not.</p>
A <i>generation</i> is a snapshot of the state of the board at a particular
time.<p></p>

<p>
The fate of a cell of the Life board in the <i>next</i> generation is entirely
determined by the state of the cell and its neighbouring cells in the
<i>current</i> generation.  Each cell is defined to have <i>eight</i>
neighbours - diagonal neighbours are included here.
The rule for the fate of a cell is as follows:
</p><ul>
<li>
Any cell with exactly two live neighbours doesn't change in the next generation.
</li>
<li>
Any cell with exactly three live neighbours will be alive in the next generation.
</li>
<li>
A cell with any <i>other</i> number of live neighbours will be dead in the next generation.
</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><p>
Here is a sequential Java program to simulate the evolution of the
Life board:
</p><pre>  import java.awt.* ;
  import javax.swing.* ;

  public class Life {

      final static int N = 1024 ;
      final static int CELL_SIZE = 1 ;
      final static int DELAY = 0 ;

      static int [][] state = new int [N][N] ;

      static int [][] sums  = new int [N][N] ;

      static Display display = new Display() ;
  
      public static void main(String args []) throws Exception {
  
          // Define initial state of Life board
  
          for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
              for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                  state [i] [j] = Math.random() &gt; 0.5 ? 1 : 0 ;
              }
          }
  
          display.repaint() ;
          pause() ;
  
          // Main update loop.
  
          int iter = 0 ;
          while(true) {
  
              System.out.println("iter = " + iter++) ;
  
              // Calculate neighbour sums.
  
              for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
                   for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
  
                        // find neighbours...
                        int ip = (i + 1) % N ;
                        int im = (i - 1 + N) % N ;
                        int jp = (j + 1) % N ;
                        int jm = (j - 1 + N) % N ;
  
                        sums [i] [j] =
                            state [im] [jm] + state [im] [ j] + state [im] [jp] +
                            state [ i] [jm]                   + state [ i] [jp] +
                            state [ip] [jm] + state [ip] [ j] + state [ip] [jp] ;
                  }
              }
  
              // Update state of board values.
      
              for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
                  for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                      switch (sums [i] [j]) {
                          case 2 : break;
                          case 3 : state [i] [j] = 1; break;
                          default: state [i] [j] = 0; break;
                      }
                  }
              }
      
              display.repaint() ;
              pause() ;
          }
      }
  
      static class Display extends JPanel {
  
          final static int WINDOW_SIZE = N * CELL_SIZE ;
  
          Display() {

              setPreferredSize(new Dimension(WINDOW_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE));

              JFrame frame = new JFrame("Life");
              frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
              frame.setContentPane(this);
              frame.pack();
              frame.setVisible(true);
          }
  
          public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
              g.setColor(Color.BLACK) ;
              g.fillRect(0, 0, WINDOW_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE) ;
              g.setColor(Color.WHITE) ;
              for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; N ; i++) {
                  for(int j = 0 ; j &lt; N ; j++) {
                      if(state [i] [j] == 1) {
                          g.fillRect(CELL_SIZE * i, CELL_SIZE * j,
                                     CELL_SIZE, CELL_SIZE) ;
                      }
                  }
              } 
          }
      }
  
      static void pause() {
          try {
              Thread.sleep(DELAY) ;
          }
          catch(InterruptedException e) {
              e.printStackTrace() ;
              System.exit(1) ;
          }
      }
  }
</pre>
You don't need to worry much about the nested class <tt>Display</tt>
at the bottom of this code.  As the name suggests it is just used to display
the current state of the Life board.<p></p>

<p>
The main array of the problem is <tt>state</tt>.  This represents
the Life board, and is 1 for live cells and 0 for dead cells.
<tt>sums</tt> is an extra array that will be used to keep a record of
the number of live neighbours of a particular cell.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
The board is initialized randomly, with a fifty-fifty chance of a given
cell being alive or dead.</p>

<p>
The main loop is an infinite loop over generations.  Inside that is
a loop over cells that calculates how many live neighbours that cell
has (by just adding up the <tt>state</tt> values of the neighbours).
Then there is another loop over cells which calculates the state of
the cell in the next generation in terms of it's number of live neighbours.
</p>

<p>
The calculation of subscripts for cells neighbouring <i>i</i> and
<i>j</i> needs some explanation.  The most obvious way of calculating
index of a neighbour in the positive <i>i</i> direction, say, would be
as <span class="eqn"><i>i</i> + 1</span>.  But that causes a problem
at the edges of the board when <i>i</i> is <span class="eqn"><i>N</i>
- 1</span>.  We can't have a subscript value of <i>N</i> in a Java array
of size <i>N</i>.  The same problem arises for negative neighbours of
cells with subcript 0.
</p>

<p>
Convince yourself that the prescription given above circumvents this
problem by making the board to "wrap around" at the edges - the positive
neighbour of <span class="eqn"><i>N</i> - 1</span> is 0, and the negative
neighbour of 0 is <span class="eqn"><i>N</i> - 1</span>.</p>

<h2>Sequential Experiments</h2>

<p>
Experiment with the Life program.  Run it for different sizes of board,
controlled by the constant <tt>N</tt>.  The constant <tt>CELL_SIZE</tt>
only controls the display - it is the width of a cell in pixels.  You
may want to increase this to get a better view of what is going on.
It may also be helpful to set <tt>DELAY</tt> to a non-zero value.
This just controls a delay in milliseconds between generations - again
increasing this may give you get a better idea of how things work.</p>

<p>
For the time being we won't bother with timings.  The trouble is that
the graphics display slows things down, and the timings we usually
care about are for the <i>computations</i>.  Eventually - when we have a clear
idea of how our programs are behaving - we may strip out the graphics
and try some benchmarking.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>
Try to parallelize the <tt>Life</tt> program following a strategy similar
to the one we used with the <tt>Mandelbrot</tt> program.
</p>

<p>
The initialization loops can be left in the <tt>main</tt> method.
But the "Main update loop" should be moved into the <tt>run</tt> method
of your <tt>ParallelLife</tt> class.  Try to write the code to
run on <tt>P</tt> threads (with <tt>P</tt> declared as a constant).

</p><p>
<i>Hints</i>: The whole of the main <tt>while(true)</tt> loop will run in
each thread, but <i>both</i> the embedded loop nests over <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>
("Calculate neighbour sums" and "Update state of board values")
are candidates for decomposition, similar to that done in the main
loops of the Mandelbrot code above.  For now just use a blockwise
decomposition of the <i>i</i> loops - <i>cyclic decomposition is not very
appropriate here</i>.</p>

<p>
One thing to bear in mind is that in general you do <i>not</i> particularly
want I/O operations to run in parallel on multiple threads.  This will
lead to confusion and possibly errors.  In
the <i>Life</i> code there are two output operations - the <tt>System.out.println</tt> call that prints the current iteration number, and the
<tt>display.repaint()</tt> operation that dumps the graphic display
of the board state.  I suggest that you leave just thread 0 to do both
these operations, by enclosing these lines in an <tt>if</tt> construct like:
</p><pre>  if(me == 0) {
      ...
  }
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Does your code appear to work correctly?  Try running it in four threads, then,
just to be sure, try running
it with a <i>large</i> number of threads - e.g. try a run something
like this:
</p><pre>  final static int P = 256 ;
  final static int N = 256 ;
  final static int CELL_SIZE = 4 ;
</pre>
<p></p>
