<h1>Using the Hadoop Cluster</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
School of Computing Hadoop Cluster is
a collection of computers on which you can run data analytics jobs.
This week you will log in to the Cluster, and start to explore it.
</p>

<h2>Logging in to the Cluster</h2>

<p>
It is possible to log in to the cluster through a Web browser using a
Jupyter Hub, and we may do this in some later labs.  But for now I
recommend you just use an ssh client - e.g PuTTY on Windows.
</p>

<p>
Click on the AppsAnywhere icon on the desktop, wait for validation to
succeed, then search for PuTTY.  Launch PuTTY.
</p>

<p>
In the PuTTY configuration window, set the Host Name to:
</p><pre>    mn01.soc.uni.ds.port.ac.uk
</pre>
and click Open.  If successful, the PuTTY configuration window will be
replaced by a terminal window (similar to a Command Prompt in Windows),
prompting for Linux login.
<p></p>

<p>
If you are working from home or anywhere outside the University network,
you should first install and start the <a href="https://kb.myport.ac.uk/Article/Index/12/4?id=2504">VPN client</a>.  You may also need to install PuTTY
from <a href="https://www.putty.org/">www.putty.org</a><a></a></p><a>

<p>
For future convenience you may want to "save a session" in the PuTTY
configuration, <i>before</i> clicking Open.  Under "Saved Sessions"
type a short, memorable name like "mn01" then click "Save".  In future
you can just click on the
short name, then "Open", rather than remembering the full host name.</p>

<p>
If your home computer is a Mac, you still need the VPN but you don't
need PuTTY.  Instead open a Terminal on your Mac and issue a command similar
to:
</p><pre>  $ /usr/bin/ssh up<i>DDDDDD</i>@mn01.soc.uni.ds.port.ac.uk
</pre>
where <tt>up<i>DDDDDD</i></tt> is the account name defined below.<p></p>


<h2>Account names and passwords</h2>

<p>
Your
user name will be the same as your university account id, all in lower
case.  So something like this:
</p><pre>  up<i>DDDDDD</i>
</pre>
where all the <i>D</i>'s are digits.  Type this at the "login as:"
prompt.   Your initial password will be given
to you in the class.  <i>It is not the same as the password for your
general university account.</i>  If you are unfamiliar with Linux ways,
don't be put off by the fact that there is no echo as you type your password!
Just go ahead and type the password followed by carriage return.<p></p>

<p>
If log in is successful, you should meet a prompt ended by a "$" sign, where
you can start typing Linux commands, if you know any.
</p>


<h2>Changing your password</h2>

<p>If you are already familar with Linux commands and the bash shell,
you can skip much of the rest of this tutorial<!-- and go straight to the discussion of
interacting with HDFS-->.  First, however, <i>everybody must change their
password!</i></p>

<p>
At the command prompt (which ends with a dollar sign, $), type:
</p><pre>  $ passwd
</pre>
It should be spelt exactly like that: "passwd".

<p><i>Do not</i> type the $ above, that's just the conventiona I'll
use throughout these tutorials for highlighting commands to be issued.
If there isn't a $ at the start of one of my lines, it probably is
<i>not</i> a command to be executed in the Linux shell!</p>

<p>
You will be prompted for you current password, then for the new password, which
you will have to repeat.  <i>Please do not choose a weak password!</i>
If the passwd command warns against using a particular password, exit the
command and start again with a different password.
</p>

<p>
The passwd command only directly changes the password on the head node.
When everyone has updated their passwords, I will propagate the changes
through to all the worker nodes.</p>

<h2>Nodes of the Cluster</h2>

<p>The slightly odd naming of the 9 nodes of the cluster is as follows:
</p><pre>  mn01.soc
  mn02.soc
  mn03.soc
  mn04.soc
  wn01.soc
  wn02.soc
  wn03.soc
  wn04.soc
  wn05.soc
<!--
  wn06.soc
  wn07.soc
  wn08.soc
  wn09.soc
--></pre>
Originally there was a plan for the first four nodes all to take on some
"master" role, and for the remaining five to be "workers".  That
is not the current usage, but for now the naming has stuck.<p></p>

<p>
When you first log in you will be on the "head node", mn01.soc.  You
can't log in directly to any of the other nodes from the outside world (and
in fact no nodes except the head node have Internet connections to the outside
world).</p>

<p>
But you may find it interesting to "hop around" some of these nodes.  From your
initial location on mn01.soc, you can for example log in to wn01.soc by:
</p><pre>  $ ssh wn01.soc
</pre>
If you get some messages saying a host authenticity can't be established,
and asking if you're sure you want to continue connecting, type "yes".  This
is common the first time you log in to a host.  (It does have to be "yes" - just "y" won't do.)  Type your cluster password when prompted.<p></p>

<p>
If successful this will start a new command shell on wn01.soc
in the same window.
A changed command prompt will be the only immediately
obvious evidence you have "moved".</p>

<p>
This command:
</p><pre>  $ hostname
</pre>
returns the name of the current host.
<p></p>

<p>
From this host you can successively "hop" to other hosts by issuing further
ssh commands.
</p>

<p>
Issue the command:
</p><pre>  $ exit
</pre>
or as a shorthand just type CTRL-D, to shutdown the remote shell and
"return" (immediately or eventually) to mn01.soc.<p></p>

<h2>The Linux File System</h2>

<p>
Linux has a hierarchical file system consisting of ordinary files and
directories, quite similar to Windows (in Linux the equivalent to a folder
is called a directory).  Linux uses the forward slash, "/", instead of the
backward slash, "\", to separate elements of path names.  And in Linux
the <i>root directory</i> is called simply "/" (in Windows root directories
go by names like "C:\").</p>

<p>
The ls command lists the contents of a directory.  To get your bearings
try:
</p><pre>  $ ls /
</pre>
The output will be a colour coded list of files and directories (mostly
directories) that live in the root directory.<p></p>

<p>
One of the directories in "/" will be "home".  List this in turn:
</p><pre>  $ ls /home
</pre>
Most of the entries you will see will be the "home directories" of the
various users who currently have accounts on the system.  Another notable
directory in the root directory is "/etc", which is the default location
for storing initialization and configuration data in Linux (some of the
kinds of things that are stored in the Registry on Windows).<p></p>

<p>
At any particular time, the terminal has one singled out directory called
the current working directory or present working directory.  When you first
log in to the system, the working directory is your home directory.
To find your current working directory, issue this command:
</p><pre>  $ pwd
</pre>
If you issue the ls command without any arguments:
<pre>  $ ls
</pre>
it will list the contents of the current working directory.  If this is
your home directory it is likely to be rather empty.  You may see a bit
more if you try this version:
<pre>  $ ls -a
</pre>
The -a option means "also display hidden files".  In Linux, hidden files
are just files whose name begins with the dot charactor ".".<p></p>

<p>
To create a new directory, issue a command like:
</p><pre>  $ mkdir mytestdir
</pre>
The ls command should now display this directory along with anything else.
To <i>change your working directory</i> to the new directory use the cd
command:
<pre>  $ cd mytestdir
</pre>
If you now do "ls" again, it will show nothing, because mytestdir is empty.
To create a text file in this directory you may use the nano editor, for
example:
<pre>  $ nano myfile.txt
</pre>
Type some text.  Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around your text area
if you want to change it (in this kind of editor you can't use the mouse to
move the cursor).  When you have done enough in nano, hit the CTRL-X key.
You will be asked if you want to save the modified buffer - usual answer
"y".  If you are happy with the name of file the changes are to be written
to, just hit return to leave nano.<p></p>

<p>
ls should now show your new file.  To view its contents (without editting)
you can use the "cat" command, e.g.:
</p><pre>  $ cat myfile.txt
</pre>
If it is a longer text file you want to display, try instead the "more"
command, which outputs contents in screen size chunks, e.g.:
<pre>  $ more longfile.txt
</pre>
At the end of each screen type the space bar to go to the next screen, or
"q" to abandon viewing the file.<p></p>

<h2>Ownerships and Permissions on files</h2>

<p>
Working in the directory where you just created a new text file, issue
the "long listing" command:
</p><pre>  $ ls -l
</pre>
Here is some output I got from that command:
<pre>  total 4
  -rw-r--r-- 1 dbc hdfs 37 Jan 31 09:58 myfile.txt
</pre>
Some of the information in the long listing is self explanatory.  The
date and time "Jan 31 09:58" is the time the file was created.  The number
"37" is the length of the file in bytes.<p></p>

<p>
The string "dbc" is my account ID (it's actually my initials).  You should
see your "up" ID here.  "hdfs" is actually a Linux group, which isn't
very relevant to us for the moment.  But what is this string at the beginning:
</p><pre>  -rw-r--r--
</pre>
?<p></p>

<p>
In general this sequence of 10 characters is the "permissions" on the file.
A hyphen here is generally a missing permission, as we will see below.  But the
very first hyphen here actually gives us information on the file type.
For an ordinary file like "myfile.txt" it will have this field has the
value "-".  For a directory it has the value "d".</p>

<p>
The following 9 characters represent access permissions to the file for
various users of the system.  The first sequence of 3:
</p><pre>  rw-
</pre>
are the permissions for the owner of the file (me).  I am allowed to read
or write the file.  If I was also allowed to execute the file, the third
character would be "x" rather than "-".  But this is not an executable file
so even as owner I am not allowed to execute it.<p>

</p><p>
The next sequence of three permissions:
</p><pre>  r--
</pre>
are the access permissions of users in the ownership group "hdfs".  I
don't want to discuss these groups in detail here, but suffice to say
that users in this group can read the file, but not write it or execute
it.<p></p>

<p>
The last sequence of three looks the same, but this refers to <i>all
other users on the system</i>.  Again they can read the file but not
write or execute it.</p>

<p>
As owner of the file, I can change the permissions on the file.  For example
I might decided that I don't want ordinary users to be able to read my file
so I would remove "r" in the "all other users" section.  Or I might change
my file into an executable script file in some language, in which case I
may add "x" for the owner of the file.</p>

</a><p><a>
To change permissions on files and directories you use the "chmod" command.
There are a lot of possible options on this command, so I will refer you
to </a><a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/permissions.php">this
online tutorial</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Short Cuts - avoiding typing</h2>

<p>
One important short cut to know is "file name completion".  When typing a
command that depends on one or more file name, you can usually type just the
first few characters of the name, then hit the TAB character.  If there is
an unambiguous completion for the name, the shell completes the name for
you.  This avoids a lot of typing, and a lot of spelling mistakes.</p>

<p>
To repeat the previous command, use the up arrow.  This displays the last
command, and you just have to hit return to run it again.  You can scroll
up through multiple recent commands by repeating the up arrow, and use
the left and right arrow keys to edit and tweak the selected previous
command, before hitting return to execute it.</p>

<p>
Occasionally it is quicker to use "history substitution" - I'll give
the two most useful examples of that:
</p><ul>
<li>The character sequence "!!" represents the last command executed.  You can just type:
<pre>  $ !!
</pre>
and hit return and that repeats the last command.  This isn't a great gain over
using "up arrow", but you can also add extra text at the beginning or end
of the command, e.g.:
<pre>  $ sudo !!
</pre>
That repeats the previous command with "sudo" prepended in front of it. (What is
sudo?  You will have to go and look it up.  For the record you probably won't have sudo privileges on the cluster!)
</li>
<li>
The character sequence "!$" represents <i>just the last argument</i> of the last
command executed.  Here is an example of how you might use that:
<pre>  $ ls -l myfile.txt
  $ cat !$
</pre>
Here, after looking at the properties of the file "myfile.txt", you decide
you want
to look at its contents.  In the second command you use the the shorthand "!$"
to avoid retyping the file name.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>
Finally, not really a short cut, but a vital key sequence to know: if a 
command or program is running at the terminal, and it isn't doing what you
want it to do, you can <i>kill</i> that command by typing CTRL-C.</p>

<h2>Pipes and Redirection</h2>

<p>
We have seen examples of commands that write to and read from named files.
All running processes (including all commands you execute) also have a
<i>standard input</i> and a <i>standard output</i> that they can read from
or write to, if they need to.  When the command is executed in the ordinary
way from the terminal, the standard input defaults to the keyboard and
the standard output defaults to the screen.</p>

<p>
The cat command is an example of a command that by default sends its
output to standard output, which is typically the screen.  Very often
you can omit input file name arguments from commands and they will take
there input from standard input, e.g. the keyboard.  For example try this:
</p><pre>  $ cat
</pre>
Initially this sits there doing nothing.  But now type some lines of
text and you will see them echoed as cat reads from its standard input
and writes what it reaceives to its standard output.  (You can type
CTRL-C to end this command.)<p></p>

<p>
As a general feature, the shell lets you redirect the standard output ("screen output") of any command or program to a file.  The general sequence is:
</p><pre>  $ <i>some-command</i> &gt; <i>new-file-name</i>
</pre>
where you choose the "new-file-name" (if it is an existing file it will
be overwritten).  The output file may be a text file, but that depends on
what the program is generating.  The general syntax is you follow the
command (which might be a very complicated command in general) by a chevron,
"&gt;", followed by the target file name.<p></p>

<p>
Likewise you can arrange for any program that is reading from the
standard input stream (the keyboard typically) to take that input from a file
instead by syntax like this: 
</p><pre>  $ <i>some-command</i> &lt; input-lines.txt
</pre>
where in my example the input is now coming from a file called
"input-lines.txt" instead of the keyboard.<p></p>

<p>
An even more powerful facility is "piping" the (standard) output of one
command to the standard input of another command.  Here the syntax is
like this:
</p><pre>  $ <i>source-command</i> | <i>destination-command</i>
</pre>
The crucial thing here is the pipe symbol, or vertical bar, "|", joining the
two commands.
<p></p>

<p>
Although you can do lots of creative things with pipes, the single most
common use is probably applying the "more" filter after a command that
produces a lot of output.</p>

<p>
For example, if you type this command:
</p><pre>  $ ls -R /etc
</pre>
it will recursively list all the contents of the system configuration directory
/etc.  This produces a lot of output, and most of it just scrolls past.<p></p>

<p>
If the more command mentioned earlier is executed with no file name argument,
it takes it's input from standard in.  So this pipeline:
</p><pre>  $ ls -R /etc | more
</pre>
will scroll through the contents of the configuration directory in manageable
screen sized chunks (recall you type the space bar the end of each screen to go to the next screen, or "q" to abandon viewing the data).<p></p>

<h2>Getting Data to the Cluster</h2>

<p>Often when you are working on a PC, say, you will find a data set on the Web
somewhere, and download through the browser, then you can work on the
downloaded file in situ on your computer.</p>

<p>In terms of getting data onto the cluster, the problem is we can't
actually run a browser <i>on</i>
the cluster, not even on the head node.  Your only access is through a
Linux terminal.  So how do we download (or upload) data to the cluster?
</p>

<p>If your data is somewhere on the Web, you might be able to find a
direct URL to the data file by browsing on your client computer.  You
then may be able to download that data file directly to the cluster
by running a command like this:
</p><pre>  $ /usr/bin/curl <i>URL</i>
</pre>
on mn01.soc.  Here <i>URL</i> is the URL for the data you found earlier.<p></p>

<p>
If for some reason that approach isn't applicable, or you already have your
data files on your client computer, you will have to use an <i>scp client</i>
to transfer the file(s) to the cluster.</p>

<p>
The most popular of these for Windows is probably WinSCP, which is available
through AppsAnywhere or is free to download.  We give brief instructions
below for using WinSCP to upload data to the cluster.</p>

<h3>Using WinSCP</h3>

<p>
On one of the lab PCs (or your home machine, with VPN running), start
WinSCP.
</p>

<p>
Change the File Protocol to "SCP" - "SFTP" is <i>not</i> supported by our cluster.</p>

Set the Host name to:
<pre>    mn01.soc.uni.ds.port.ac.uk
</pre>
as we did above with PuTTY (leave the port as 22).<p></p>

<p>
Enter your user name and password for the cluster, as discussed earlier.</p>

<p>
Save all this session information if you wish, or just immediately click
on Login.</p>

<p>
If login is successful, directory browsers for your files on the PC and
for your home directory on the cluster will appear side by side, and
you can for example drag and drop files between the two.</p>
