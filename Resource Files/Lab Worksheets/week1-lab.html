<h1>Parallel Programming Lab, Week 1:<br>Java Threads for Parallelism - Reprise</h1>

</div>

<div id="content">

<p>
In this first week we haven't covered enough material in the
lectures to do much <i>new</i> work on parallel programming.
But many of you will have some experience of multi-threaded programming
in Java from the second year module on operating systems and 
architectures (COSINE).  For those of you who <i>did</i> attend COSINE, this
week's lab will be a refresher on using Java threads to speed up
a simple calculation through parallelism.  For any of you who <i>did
not</i>, hopefully this will act as a primer.
</p>

<p>
In fact the lab script here is only slightly adapted from the final
lab script in the first term of COSINE, so some of you have already seen
this material.  But it will become much more relevant in the context of the
current module; please go through it and make sure you attempt the
exercises at the end.</p>

<p>
I am going to assume you know how to compile and run Java
programs on the computers in the lab.  Talk to me if you do <i>not</i>.
A popular option for this is likely to
be NetBeans, available through AppsAnywhere under Windows.  Other
plausible possiblities include the Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) or
Eclipse.  Unfortunately neither of the latter are currently available
on the Windows build of the lab machines, but I expect many of you will
be using your home computers this year.</p>
<!--
on the Windows boot of the lab machines, though JDK is available under
the CentOS boot - well worth considering if you are comfortable with
Linux!</p>

If you need a reminder, <a

labs</a> may help.</p>

<h2>Calculating <i>π</i></h2>

<p>
There are many ways to approximately calculate the mathematical constant
<i>π</i>.  One "brute force" method is based on the following formula from
calculus:
</p>
<p>
<img src="./week1-lab_files/pi-integral.png" height="70">
</p>
<p>
Using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration"><i>rectangle
rule</i></a> for numerical integration, this can be approximated by breaking
up the <i>x</i> range into steps:</p>
<p>
<img src="./week1-lab_files/pi-sum.png" height="120">
</p>
<p>
where <i>N</i> is the number of steps, and:</p>
<p>
<img src="./week1-lab_files/h-definition.png" height="35">
</p>
<p>
is the size of a single step.</p>

<p>
Using JDK or NetBeans, create a Java program or project to calculate the sum
numerically.  Your main class may look like this:
</p><pre>  public class SequentialPi {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

          int numSteps = 10000000;

          double step = 1.0 / (double) numSteps;

          double sum = 0.0;

          for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; numSteps ; i++){
              double x = (i + 0.5) * step ;
              sum += 4.0 / (1.0 + x * x);
          }

          double pi = step * sum ;

          System.out.println("Value of pi: " + pi);
      }

  }
</pre>
Here the constant <i>N</i> is represented by the value of the variable
<tt>numSteps</tt>.  We have set it to 10 million, which is enough to
get a pretty accurate estimate of <i>π</i>.<p></p>

<p>
In Java, <tt>double</tt> is one of the standard types for representing
a floating point number.</p>

<p>
Run this program and record the result.  Compare it with known
estimates of <i>π</i> - look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Approximate_value">here</a>,
for example.</p>


<h2>A Parallel Program</h2>

<p>
Our formula for calculating <i>π</i> is simply a large sum of independent
terms.  
<!--Problems like this are sometimes called <i>embarassingly
parallel</i>.  What this means is that they are <i>really</i> easy
to break down into sub-tasks that can be run in parallel.  (Some people
are just embarassed when problems are too simple - most of the time
parallelising code is harder.)
-->
In this case we can break the sum into two halves (say) and
do two sums in separate threads.  Then at the end we just have to add together
the two numbers that emerge.</p>

<p>
Here is a program that does that:
</p><pre>  public class ParallelPi extends Thread {

      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

          ParallelPi thread1 = new ParallelPi();
          thread1.begin = 0 ;
          thread1.end = numSteps / 2 ;

          ParallelPi thread2 = new ParallelPi();
          thread2.begin = numSteps / 2 ;
          thread2.end = numSteps ;

          thread1.start();
          thread2.start();
        
          thread1.join();
          thread2.join();

          double pi = step * (thread1.sum + thread2.sum) ;
        
          System.out.println("Value of pi: " + pi);
      }

      static int numSteps = 10000000;
    
      static double step = 1.0 / (double) numSteps;

      double sum ;  
      int begin, end ;

      public void run() {

          sum = 0.0 ;

          for(int i = begin ; i &lt; end ; i++){
              double x = (i + 0.5) * step ;
              sum += 4.0 / (1.0 + x * x);
          }
      }
  }
</pre>
Remember that in Java a <i>thread</i> is implemented by creating an instance
of a class that extends the <tt>Thread</tt> class.  Any such class will
have to have a <tt>run()</tt> method which contains the work that is
executed in the thread.  A parent program (our <tt>main()</tt> method)
spawns a thread by
executing the <tt>start()</tt> method on a thread object.<p></p>

<p>
A thread finishes when its <tt>run()</tt> method completes.
The parent program can - as here - wait until spawned threads finish
by executing the join method on the thread object.</p>

<p>
The main calculation is done in the <tt>run()</tt> method of the threads.
You'll notice this is very similar to the main loop of the sequential
program, except that the loop goes from some <tt>begin</tt> value to
some <tt>end</tt> value.  These values are set in fields of the thread
objects, created by the main program.  We have two thread objects
and the first one does the sum from 0 up to <tt>numSteps/2</tt>,
and the second object does the sum from <tt>numSteps/2</tt> up to
<tt>numSteps</tt>.</p>

<p>
In the interests of simplicitly, I have eschewed good
object-oriented pratices - so the main program directly accesses
instance variables of objects it creates (<tt>begin</tt>, <tt>end</tt>,
<tt>sum</tt>, etc).  If this offends your sensibilities, feel free to
rewrite the code in a more OO fashion!</p>

<p></p>
Although the strategy really is straightforward, you'll notice the program
suddenly got much longer.  This is fairly typical of parallel programs.
As this course develops you will meet various other programming
paradigms that try to make parallel programming easier.<p></p>

<p>
The total number of steps is the same as for the sequential program, but
this time we have defined this value in a static variable, so it can easily
be shared by two threads.</p>

<p>
Run this program.  The exact result for <i>π</i> will be slightly different
to the result from the sequential program, because the additions in
the sum are performed in a different order, and rounding errors will
accumulate slightly differently.  But the accuracy of the result should
be similar.
</p>

<h2>Benchmarking</h2>

<p>
There isn't much point doing parallel programming if it doesn't make
our programs go faster.  We need to time the runs for the sequential
and parallel versions of our program, and compare how long each takes.
</p>

<p>
We will use the method <tt>System.currentTimeMillis()</tt> to get the
current time.  The time is represented in a interesting way -
as the number of milliseconds that have elapsed from midnight,
January 1, 1970.  The base date - the beginning of 1970 - is sometimes called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time"><i>UNIX Epoch</i></a>.
Roughly speaking, it is when the UNIX operating system was invented.
This is an important date for Java and other languages influenced by
UNIX.</p>

<p>
For our benchmarks we only care about the difference between two times -
the time when the computation starts and the time when it ends.  Using
<tt>currentTimeMillis()</tt> and taking a difference will naturally give us the
time for the computation in milliseconds.</p>

<p>
Change the main method of the <tt>SequentialPi</tt> to look like this:
</p><pre>      public static void main(String[] args) {

          long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

          int numSteps = 10000000;

          double step = 1.0 / (double) numSteps;

          double sum = 0.0;

          for(int i = 0 ; i &lt; numSteps ; i++){
              double x = (i + 0.5) * step ;
              sum += 4.0 / (1.0 + x * x);
          }

          double pi = step * sum ;

          long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

          System.out.println("Value of pi: " + pi);

          System.out.println("Calculated in " +
                             (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
    }
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Run the new version, and record the time taken.</p>

<p>
Similarly, change the main method of <tt>ParallelPi</tt> to look like this:
</p><pre>      public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

          long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

          ParallelPi thread1 = new ParallelPi();
          thread1.begin = 0 ;
          thread1.end = numSteps / 2 ;

          ParallelPi thread2 = new ParallelPi();
          thread2.begin = numSteps / 2 ;
          thread2.end = numSteps ;

          thread1.start();
          thread2.start();
        
          thread1.join();
          thread2.join();

          long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

          double pi = step * (thread1.sum + thread2.sum) ;
        
          System.out.println("Value of pi: " + pi);

          System.out.println("Calculated in " +
                             (endTime - startTime) + " milliseconds");
      }
</pre>
and record the time this version takes to run.
<p></p>

<p>
The ratio of the time for the sequential run to time for the parallel run
is called the <i>parallel speedup</i>:</p>
<p>
<img src="./week1-lab_files/speedup-definition.png" height="60">
</p>
<p>
Calculate the parallel speedup for your runs.  Is it 2?  Explain.
</p>

<p>
Reduce <tt>numSteps</tt> to 1000000 (1 million), run both programs
again and calculate the new parallel speedup.  Increase <tt>numSteps</tt>
to 1000000000 (1 billion).  Calculate the parallel speedup again.
Explain your results.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Make a "quad-core" version of <tt>ParallelPi</tt> that divides the
range of the sum into four equal parts, and uses four threads.
Does this version go faster than the two-threaded version?
How many cores does your machine have?
</p><p>
(If you finish that, you may try to increase the number of threads further to exploit hyperthreading - ask me if you don't know what this means!)
</p></li>
<li>
<p>
Try using <tt>System.nanoTime()</tt> in place of
<tt>System.currentTimeMillis()</tt> for timing.  Does this give more
accurate results?
</p></li></ol>
